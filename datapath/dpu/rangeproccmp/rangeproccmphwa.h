/**

 * [TOC]
 *  @section toplevel_hwa Top Level Design
 *
 *  Range FFT processing is done by HWA hardware. Based on the RF parameters, rangeProcCmpHWA configures
 *  hardware accelerator FFT engine accordingly. Once the FFT is complete, the HWA compresses the FFT output by a programmable coefficient. 
 *  It also configures data input and output EDMA channels to bring data in and out of range Processing memory.
 *
 *  HWA FFT process is triggered by hardware based trigger -"chirp data available" which is hooked up to HWA internally in hardware.
 *
 *  After FFT processing and compression is done, HWA generates interrupt to rangeProcCmpHWA DPU, at the same time triggers EDMA data
 *  output channel to copy FFT results to radarCube in configured format. EDMA interrupt done interrupt is triggered by EDMA hardware
 *  after the copy is completed.
 *
 *  DC antenna signal calibration and removal is built into the rangeProcCmpHWA Module.
 *  If the feature is enabled, it is done after all chirps (in the frame) FFT
 *  processing is completed.
 *
 *  The following diagram shows the top level design for rangeProcCmpHWA.
 *
 *  @image html rangeproccmphwa_toplevel.png "rangeProcCmpHWA Top Level"
 *
 *  The following diagram shows a general timing diagram for a 3 tx antenna MIMO
 *  case but can be imagined to hold for 1 or 2 tx cases as well. All use cases
 *  described in later sections have this general timing flow.
 *
 *  @image html datapath_1d_timing.png "Timing Diagram"
 *
 *  @section config_hwa Data Interface Parameter Range
 *
 *  Here are supported ADCBuf and radarCube interface configurations:
 *
 *  ADCBuf Data Interface
 *----------------------
 *
 *   Parameter | Supported value
 *  :----------|:----------------:
 *   dataFmt | @ref DPIF_DATAFORMAT_COMPLEX16_IMRE  only
 *   interleave|interleave (@ref DPIF_RXCHAN_INTERLEAVE_MODE) and non-interleave (@ref DPIF_RXCHAN_NON_INTERLEAVE_MODE)
 *   numChirpsPerChirpEvent|1 ONLY
 *   numRxAntennas|1, 2 or 4
 *   numAdcSamples|64 - 1024
 *
 *
 *  Radar Cube Data Interface
 *----------------------
 *
 *   Parameter | Supported value
 *  :----------|:----------------:
 *   datafmt | @ref DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_1 and @ref DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_2 only
 *   numTxAntennas|1, 2 and 3
 *   numRangeBins|64 - 1024
 *   numChirpsPerFrame|As AdcBuf and HWA memory permit, numChirpsPerFrame/numTxAntennas should be an even number
 *
 *  @note  For 1024 Range bins with 1 TX , 4 RX antenna and @ref DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_1,
 *         it is not currently supported due to EDMA address jump limitation (jump < 32768).
 *  @note  For 1024 Range bins with 3 TX , 4 RX antenna and @ref DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_1,
 *         it is not currently supported due to EDMA address jump limitation (jump < 32768).
 *  @note  Due to the Ping/Pong scheme implemented in rangeProcCmpHWA DPU, numChirpsPerFrame/numTxAntennas should be an even number.
 *
 *  @section input_hwa Data Input
 *
 *  There are two HWA input mode supported (@ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_InputMode_e),
 *  -  @ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_InputMode_ISOLATED : \n
 *     ADCBuf buffer and HWA memory are isolated in physical memory space.
 *     Data input EDMA channel is configured to transfer data from ADCBuf to HWA M0/M1 memory
 *     in ping/pong alternate order.
 *  -  @ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_InputMode_MAPPED :\n
 *     ADCBuf buffer and HWA memory are mapped. HWA can read ADC data directly. No copy is needed.
 *
 *  Depending on the RF configuration, the data in ADCBuf can be either interleaved or non-interleaved mode.
 *
 *  @section output_hwa Data Output
 *
 *  RangeProcCmpHWA configures data output EDMA channels to transfer FFT results from HWA M2/M3 to radarCube memory.
 *
 *  The following two radarCube formats are supported in rangeProcCmpHWA.
 *  - \ref DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_1
 *  - \ref DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_2
 *
 *  The following table describes the suppoted data input and output combinations:
 *
 *   Interleave Mode | DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_1 |  DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_2
 *  :----------|:----------------:|:-----------:
 *   interleave | NOT supported  | Supported
 *  non-interleave|Supported | Supported
 *
 *
 *
 *  @section process_hwa Data Processing
 *
 *  Range FFT processing is done by HWA hardware. As shown in the following diagram, after @ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_config is completed,
 *  in every frame, rangeProcCmpHWA is triggered through @ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_control \n
 *  using command @ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_Cmd_triggerProc. If the hardware resources are overlaid with other modules,
 *  @ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_config can be called before the next frame start. \n
 *
 *  DC signal removal configuration  can be updated at inter-frame time before the next frame starts.
 *
 * @image html hwa_callflow.png "rangeProcCmpHWA call flow"
 *
 *
 *  @subsection hwa_calibDC_Range Antenna coupling signature removal
 *
 *  This feature is controlled through configuration @ref DPU_RangeProcCmp_CalibDcRangeSigCfg_t.
 *  The configuration can be sent to rangeProcCmpHWA DPU through API @ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_config. \n
 *  The configuration can also be updated at runtime through control command @ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_Cmd_dcRangeCfg.
 *
 *  DC signal calibration and compensation is operated on radarCube directly by the CPU.
 *

 *
 *
 *  @section hwa_usecase Use Cases and Implementation
 *
 *  This Section describes some of the internal implementation for a few use cases with combination of input/output configurations. \n
 *
 *  @subsection hwa_impl HWA param set Implementation
 *  RangeProcCmpHWA always use 4 consecutive HWA param sets(@ref DPU_RANGEPROCCMPHWA_NUM_HWA_PARAM_SETS)  starting from paramSetStartIdx,
 *  these params will be labeled PARAM_0, PARAM_1, PARAM_2 and PARAM_3 from now onwards for convenience
 *  of explanation and picture representation.
 *  Param sets are used in two parallel processing chain in ping/pong alternate manner.
 *  PARAM_0 and PARAM_1 are used for PING and PARAM_2 and PARAM_3 are used for PONG.
 *
 *  PARAM_0 and PARAM_2 need to be activated by triggers to protect internal data memory integrity. There are initially triggered
 *  by software when starting the very first chirp. Consequently they are triggered by data out hot signature channel.
 *  PARAM_1 and PARAM_3 are Range FFT param sets for PING and PONG respectively. In directly mapped input mode, they are triggered by
 *  frontend hardware when chirp data is available. In isolated input mode, they are triggered by data in hot signature.
 *  After range FFT processing is done in HWA, HWA param sets automatically trigger data out EDMA channel to copy data to radar Cube in desired
 *  radarCube format.
 *
 *  @subsection hwa_dataIn EDMA Data In Implementation
 *  When enabled, data input EDMA is constructed utilizing two EDMA channels. The first EDMA channel copies data from ADCBuf buffer to HWA memory.
 *  The second EDMA channel is chained to the first channel. It copies hot signature to trigger range FFT param sets.\n
 *  In summary, the data in EDMA requires the following resources:
 *
 *       - 1 EDMA channel with 1 shadow channel
 *       - 1 hot Signature channel with 1 shadow channel
 *
 *  @subsection hwa_dataOut EDMA Data Out Implementation
 *  Data out EDMA is responsible for copying data from HWA memory to radar Cube memory.
 *  It has two formats (@ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_EDMAOutputConfig_t).\n
 *  @ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_EDMAOutputConfigFmt2 is only for the following configuration: \n
 *
 *   Setting | Note
 *  :------------|:-----------:
 *   @ref DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_1|  Radar Cube format 1
 *   numTxAntenna| 3 TX antenna
 *   @ref DPIF_RXCHAN_NON_INTERLEAVE_MODE|ADCBuf non interleave mode
 *
 *  All other configurations should use @ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_EDMAOutputConfigFmt1_t.
 *
 *  For EDMA dataOut Fmt1, it needs three EDMA channels, shown as follows:
 *
 *       Ping:
 *       - 1 EDMA channel with 1 shadow channel
 *
 *       Pong:
 *       - 1 EDMA channel with 1 shadow channel
 *
 *       Signature channel:
 *       - 1 HWA hot signature channel with 1 shadow channel
 *
 *  Ping and Pong EDMA channels are triggered by PARAM_1 and PARAM_3 FFT automatically. Both Ping/pong EDMA channels are chained to data out
 *  Hot Signature channel, which triggers HWA PARAM_0 AND PARAM_2 when EDMA channel copy is completed.
 *
 *  For EDMA dataOut Fmt2, it requires the following resources:\n
 *
 *       Ping:
 *       - 1 dummy EDMA channel with 3 shadow channels
 *       - 3 dataOut channel, each has a shadow channel
 *
 *       Pong:
 *       - 1 dummy EDMA channel with 3 shadow channels
 *       - 3 dataOut channel, each has a shadow channel
 *
 *       Signature channel:
 *       - 1 HWA hot signature channel with 1 shadow channel
 *
 *   The dummy EDMA channel is triggered by the HWA PARAM_1(trigger data out Ping EDMA channel) and PARAM_3(trigger data out pong EDMA channel)
 *   after FFT operation is completed.
 *   The dummy channel is linked to 3 shadow channels. The shadow channel is loaded to dummy channel in round robin order. Each dummy channel
 *   is chained to one of the 3 dataOut channel that have different source and destination address. Details are as follows:
 *
 *   Index | Source Address | Destination Address | sequence order in time
 *  :------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:------------------------:
 *   PING 1|  HWA M2  | TX1 | 1
 *   PING 2|  HWA M2  | TX3 | 3
 *   PING 3|  HWA M2  | TX2 | 5
 *   PONG 1|  HWA M3  | TX2 | 2
 *   PONG 2|  HWA M3  | TX1 | 4
 *   PONG 3|  HWA M3  | TX3 | 6
 *
 *
 *  @subsection hwa_usecase1 Interleaved RX channel data -> DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_2
 *
 *  This use case is for configuration with a directly mapped input buffer with interleaved ADC data. After Range FFT, data is saved in radar cube
 *  with format:@ref DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_2.
 *
 *  DataIn EDMA is NOT required, DataOut EDMA should be configured with format @ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_EDMAOutputConfigFmt2.\n
 *
 *   Input params | Setting
 *  :------------|:-----------:
 *   InterleaveMode | Interleave
 *  HWA input mode|Mapped
 *  RadarCube format|DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_2
 *  numTxAnt| 1, 2, 3
 *
 * @image html interleave_to_radarcubefmt2.png "Interleaved data input to DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_2"
 *
 *   Above picture illustrates a case of three transmit antennas, chirping within the frame with
 *   repeating pattern of (Tx1,Tx3,Tx2).
 *   This is the 3D profile (velocity and x,y,z) case. There are 4 rx
 *   antennas, the samples of which are color-coded and labeled as 1,2,3,4 with
 *   unique coloring for each of chirps that are processed in ping-pong manner
 *   to parallelize accelerator and EDMA processing with sample acquisition from ADC.
 *   The hardware accelerator's parameter RAMs are setup to do FFT
 *   which operates on the input ADC ping and pong buffers to produce output in M2 and M3
 *   memories of the HWA.
 *   The processing needs to be given a kick every frame, this is done by the range DPU user
 *   by issuing the IOCTL command code @ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_Cmd_triggerProc (this
 *   invokes @ref rangeProcCmpHWA_TriggerHWA) which activates the HWA's dummy
 *   params PARAM_0 (ping) and PARAM_2 (pong) which in turn activate the processing PARAMs
 *   PARAM_1 (ping) and PARAM_3 (pong), these are waiting on the ADC full signal.
 *   When ADC has samples to process in the ADC buffer Ping or Pong memories, the corresponding
 *   processing PARAM will trigger FFT calculation and transfer the FFT output into the M2 or M3 memories.
 *   Before ADC samples are sent to FFT engine, the configured FFT window is applied to them in the HWA.
 *   The completion of FFT triggers the Data Out Ping/Pong EDMAs which have been
 *   setup to do a copy with
 *   transposition from the M2/M3 memories to the L3 RAM (Radar Cube) as shown in the picture.
 *   This HWA-EDMA ping-pong processing is done @ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_StaticConfig_t::numChirpsPerFrame/2(ping/pong) times so
 *   that all chirps of the frame are processed. The EDMA
 *   is setup such that Data Out EDMAs are both chained to the Data Out Signature EDMA.
 *   So the Data Out Signature EDMA will trigger when the FFT result in M2/M3 memories
 *   is transferred to the radar cube. This signature EDMA is setup to trigger the
 *   dummy PARAMs. Even though the signature EDMA is a single EDMA channel, it is
 *   setup to alternate between the two dummy PARAMs so in effect when ping data out transfer
 *   is done, the ping dummy PARAM (PARAM_0) will be activated and when pong is done,
 *   the pong dummy PARAM (PARAM_2) will be activated.
 *   The signature EDMA is setup to give a completion interrupt after the last chirp
 *   which notifies software that range DPU processing is complete and user can trigger
 *   processing again for the next chirping period when the time comes.
 *   The shadow (link) PaRAMs of EDMA are used for reloading the PaRAMs so reprogramming
 *   is avoided. The blue arrows between EDMA blocks indicate linking and red arrows
 *   indicate chaining.
 *
 *   In further use cases, we do not describe the diagrams in such detail but
 *   the the general flow is similar. Details differ mostly in the programming
 *   of HWA and the amount of EDMA resources and their programming to
 *   handle the desired input and output formats.
 *
 *  @subsection hwa_usecase2 Non-Interleaved RX channel data -> DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_2
 *
 *  This use case is for configuration with a directly mapped input buffer with non-interleaved ADC data. After Range FFT, data is saved in radar cube
 *  with format:@ref DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_2.\n
 *  A conversion of data from non-interleaved format to interleaved format is done by PARAM_1 AND PARAM_3.
 *
 *  DataIn EDMA is NOT required, DataOut EDMA should be configured with format @ref DPU_RangeProcCmpHWA_EDMAOutputConfigFmt2.\n
